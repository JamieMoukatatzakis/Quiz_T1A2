# Implementation Plan Quiz_T1A2

## 16th November - Dealing with User Terminal Interaction Feature

Need to come up with a plan to determine where within the App I'm expecting user input. Allows me to plan proper control flow hence allowing the user to direct the App towards their choices.

1) Greet the user on launch, asking for a name. 
2) Store name into a variable and refer to the user by their name from now on.
3) Informing the user of expected output. Example 'a' 'b' 'c' or '1' '2' '3'
4) Basic error handling of User input
5) Allow user to exit App by inputing specific keys
