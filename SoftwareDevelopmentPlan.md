## Statement of Purpose and Scope

Quiz_T1A2 is a simple quiz application. After inputing a name, it allows the user to select a topic and then a question appears relating to that topic. Upon answering the first question a second one appears, and this process is repeated until three questions total have been answered. It records the users answers and scores their performance at the end of the section. The user can then quit the application or proceed to further topics if they wish. Upon the completion of 3 sections/topics a bonus question is asked and scored for a total of ten questions overall. The final result of the user is displayed and the application terminates.

On many occasions I find myself in need for a break. If you're like me, a person that enjoys puzzles and little quirky bits of knowledge, you might find yourself surfing the internet hours on end learning about random things you may not even have an interest in. Have you ever realised just how tedious this is. Finding, clicking, scrolling and navigating through countless websites, videos, forum posts, news articles and who knows what else. From this thought, an idea arised.

What if there was an Application that encompassed all that quirky knowledge with just a few keyboard strokes? And such, Quiz_T1A2 was born. An application designed to removed that tedious grunt work and provide knowledge quickly on topics that interest you in a quiz format.

This application is designed for anyone to use. However, In it's current state you will require the knowledge to navigate the terminal to its source destination and execute the relevant bash script as there is no .exe file currently. Once launched however, the application will guide the user through the whole process.

As the application is currently still in development and its features are still limited, I expect it to only be used casually or as a one off launch. As more features are added, and its selection of topics increased, users may find themselves launching the app multiple times a week.
